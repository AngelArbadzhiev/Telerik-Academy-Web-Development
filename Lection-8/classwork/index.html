            I became fascinated with the concept of speak no, see no, hear no
            evil. And - and the actual depiction of three wise monkeys. And I
            began collecting it over the years. And I kind of figured that I
            might be the - the fourth monkey, the feel no evil monkey.

            Ideas come from ordinary, everyday life. And from imagination. And
            from feelings. And from memories. Memories of dust in my sneakers
            and humming whitewalls down a hill called Monkey.

            It is not so important to be serious as it is to be serious about
            the important things. The monkey wears an expression of seriousness
            which would do credit to any college student, but the monkey is
            serious because he itches.
